    <h1>Project 2 Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <h3>What do I make?</h3>
    <p>As with any creative project deciding on a topic is often the most difficult part of the entire project.
        I didn't want to use any of the provided APIs because they didn't appeal to me, so I scoured through some of the
        internet services which I utilize and came upon a site that I frequently use for learning Japanese vocabulary called
        WaniKani. I realized that the website had an API and after looking through the documentation a bit and fidgeting with 
        the documentation a little bit I was able to get a response from the API.
    </p>
    <h3>How do I make this?</h3>
    <p>As I had never used an API to get data before &lpar;Save for the GIPHY API assignment &rpar; I had to figure out how to 
        sort through the API data to get the search information that I wanted. The information that the WaniKani API is also
        already in a JSON form so it was easy enough to read the data, the main problem was searching through it. Since I wasn't
        too confident on using the xhr and json searching things from the GIPHY assignment with a different API I fell back on 
        something that I was used to doing, which was looping. Though there is a lot of information to loop through on searches 
        (6000 results!) the site still does the process nearly instantly, so maybe a couple thousand isn't actually that intensive
        for a computer... I also figured that instead of talking to the API each time a search was made, it would be much more 
        efficient to get all the data beforehand, on load, and then just loop and search through the information I already had stored.
        This didn't impact loading the site either. After that I just had the function create html elements that contained the different
        information that each entry contains to display the information that is important to each entry.
    </p>
    <h3>Endgame</h3>
    <p>
        After looking over my website for a bit, I did decide to change up some of my code and substitute a current search feature for 
        a different one. Originally the search was done by filtering by a level from any of the three types on WaniKani. After testing 
        the function a little bit I realized that the function was very limited in its design and the amount of results that came back
        that it made the site look very sparse in terms of use. I decided to change the specific search by level and definition and made
        the search more broad so that it is possible to search for the types by either level or defintion so the user can search specifically
        for a word and also search more broadly within an entire level from the WaniKani database. During this time I was also able to 
        consolidate several seperate functions into one so that I avoid repeating myself. When getting the definition I would loop through
        and gather and display the same information as for the levels so I was able to use that same function with my new search by level
        option and also prevent myself from repeating by having the results displayed also go through just one function for both search by
        methods.
    </p>
    <h3>Mistakes</h3>
    <p>
        So the data does take a couple seconds to load so pressing the search button immediately will result in nothing being displayed.
        Though a second press will get the data. Just don't spam it.
    </p>
    <h3>Resources Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" rel="_blank" target="noopener">W3SCHOOLS THE GOAT</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.api.wanikani.com/20170710/" rel="_blank" target="noopener">WANIKANI API</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Did I meet the requirements?</h2>
    <h3>API &lpar;7.5/10&rpar;</h3>
    <p>In terms of API usage I was not able to completely fulfill the proposal that I had planned as I was going to include some 
        stats from my own usage of the WaniKani website, but that plan fell through as teh Javascript got more complex to work with
        and the deadline approached, so I was only able to complete one part of my own proposal. That part of the proposal I was still
        able to do decently well I'd say as it functions well and is able to do what it is intended to do.</p>
    <h3>Local Storage &lpar;10/10&rpar;</h3>
    <p>
        The local storage seems to be functional as it stores the user's choices for searching even after the site is closed and reopened.
    </p>
    <h3>Controls &lpar;10/10&rpar;</h3>
    <p>
        There are three controls and they all function in limiting the search parameters.
    </p>
    <h3>Error-Free &lpar;10/10&rpar;</h3>
    <p>I do not believe any errors are being thrown.</p>
    <h3>Code &lpar;10/10&rpar;</h3>
    <p>Previously I was unable to stay dry with the functions that were supposed to get all the data from the api, but I figured
        it out with a couple hours of tinkering and also was able to compress all the rest of my functions, the one that gets 
        the word's readings and meanings and the display of all the returned information into a couple unique functions. With the 
        exception of functions in my extraInfo.js, none of my functions should repeat identical code.
    </p>
    <h3>Semantic Structure &lpar;4/4&rpar;</h3>
    <p>Definitely exists and does its thing.</p>
    <h3>Valid HTML &lpar;4/4&rpar;</h3>
    <p>Yep</p>
    <h3>Valid CSS &lpar;4/4&rpar;</h3>
    <p>Yep</p>
    <h3>Visual Design &lpar;4/8&rpar;</h3>
    <p>
        I don't know how it happened but my site looks suspiciously like the GIPHY HW. I'd say the CSS is decently appealing and 
        does not destroy the eyes. 
    </p>
    <h3>Interaction Design &lpar;6/8&rpar;</h3>
    <p>So I am not sure, how it would count for this, but whenever I tested the site the search was pretty much instant. There is
        point within the JS where the note under the search input bar does inform the user that it is searching for what the user 
        input. Otherwise the note will inform of desired input and inform the user of such. 
    </p>
    <h3>Responsive Design &lpar;8/8&rpar;</h3>
    <p>Flexbox was used to ensure that the layout of information was preserved even at a lower width.</p>
    <h3>Submission &lpar;8/8&rpar;</h3>
    <p>Yep!</p>
    <h3>Documentation &lpar;6/6&rpar;</h3>
    <p>This is this! I hope this was good enough!</p>
    <h3>Total: 91.5% Maybe. Hopefully.</h3>
