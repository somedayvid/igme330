I coded it in TypeScript

In extra-info.ts I created a new function that lets me set the extra info of my page without me 
having to do the check every single time and just passing in a string with the html that should be in the extra
info sections. Other than that I just had to check to make sure some DOM elements existed before
I was able to apply html changes to them like for numresults and display.

Utils.ts remained largely the same with me just adding null checks for DOM elements and also putting return types 
and parameter types.

Hamburger.js just types the DOM.

Main.ts has an interface which holds the information for each japanese character from the API and that character
holds all the character's readings, definitions, level, and character symbols. Typed some more DOM selector variables as 
HTMLelements. Typed all the function parameters and the function returns. Import from the other ts files and also removed
the .ts from the end of them.
